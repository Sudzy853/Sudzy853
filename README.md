- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sudzy853
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity because it is extremely important in this increasingly digital world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the foundations of Cybersecurity by taking the Google Cybersecurity course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help automate processes related to Cybersecurity and tracking vulnerabilities. I also would like to collaborate on projects related to improving existing tools or creating new ones that make finding vulnerabilities easier to find and mitigate.
- My strengths are that I enjoy learning new things and just getting a better understanding of how technology works.
- 📫 How to reach me would be through email. I will leave this later when I'm ready to make this public.
